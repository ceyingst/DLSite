  taught: Spring 2024
  description: "Conjoining the abstract and philosophical to the material and the empirical, “Book Theory” might strike you as an oxymoron of a phrase. (One meaning of the word “bibliography,” after all, is “a list of authors and works cited”: in some contexts, “bibliography” designates the writing that you do when your paper is finished, and when your thinking has ceased.)  This course, however, proposes that one way to trace the contours of twentieth-century and contemporary literary theory—especially in its post-structuralist and Marxist forms—is to zero in on theorists’ recurring engagements with the nature of print communication and with the weird ontology of the book—its conjoining of form and content and its capacity, which we experience every day as readers, to be both here and elsewhere, matter and disembodied idea. In this seminar, accordingly, we will work our way through theoretical work presenting the Western book as, variously, medium, interface, commodity, and/or technology (including technology of empire)—both classic theories (e.g., Jacques Derrida, Walter Benjamin, Ernst Curtius, Gérard Genette, Roger Chartier) and more recent ones (e.g., Andrew Piper, Jessica Pressman, Jason Scott-Warren, Kelly Wisecup). We’ll also consider such topics as print, publics, memory, ephemera, and the often-announced death of the book. To assist our collective theorizing, we’ll derive resources from artists’ books and from fiction that calls attention to its own physical platform and/or mode of transmission (e.g. Laurence Sterne’s <em>Tristram Shandy</em>, Ling Ma’s <em>Severance</em>, and Heike Geissler’s <em>Seasonal Associate</em>."
- name: "It Is and Is Not a Novel: Narrative Fiction before the Nineteenth Century"
  taught: Fall 2020
  description: "When, in 1792, one Charlotte Palmer published a work of fiction entitled <em>It Is and Is Not a Novel</em>, her choice of title, both teasing and fence-sitting, suggested a long history of generic fluidity. It also suggested that by the end of the eighteenth century this history was drawing to a close, as if the moment had arrived when it could be viewed through the lens of a certain playful self-consciousness. Our work this semester will be devoted to the record of remarkable narrative experiment preceding this moment of generic consolidation: preceding the moment, which arrived later than we might think, when a disparate range of fictions—including many calling themselves “histories”—could be categorized retroactively as examples of “the” novel and treated as “imaginative literature.” Early modern writing does a remarkable job of testing our twenty-first-century expectations about literary kinds and our twenty-first-century convictions about how those kinds relate respectively to probability, knowledge, evidence, fact, and believability. We find factually-based biographies that draw unabashedly on the conventions of the heroic romance; we find travel narratives that are part allegory, part scientific discourse; and, most interestingly for our purposes, we find fictions that claim to report the truth. These early fictions’ documentary pretenses, their affinities for matters of fact and transcripts of real life, will be one recurrent concern for this seminar. The overlap between the novelist and the juror in a legal trial (both of whom, according to Ian Watt, take a “circumstantial view of life”) will be another. Throughout the semester we’ll probe Bakhtin’s suggestion that the moment of the novel coincides with that moment when Europe is thrust out of its cultural isolation and enters into relations with the entire globe—a suggestion that helps us see why questions about empire, colonial domination, racialization and chattel slavery loom so large in this writing. And one additional question that is likely to inform our discussions goes like this: why are the secret truths of female sexuality (white and black) so often the referent of early realism?"
- name: The Novel in the History of Media
  taught: Spring 2018
  description: This course investigates the rise of the novel in conjunction with the rise of modern communications networks and information technologies. It investigates this literary genre’s accounts of people’s interconnectedness alongside those projected by the postal system, the telegraph, and the radio. We’ll read widely in the history of English-language fiction—from Daniel Defoe to Jennifer Egan, by way of Sterne, Gaskell, James, and others—and in recent works of media archaeology.
