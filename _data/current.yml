- name: "<em>Paper Slips: A Literary, Material, and Media History of Scrap</em>"
  description: "Bridging literary studies, visual studies, and the history of material culture, this book is founded on an extensive archive of eighteenth-century and nineteenth-century papercraft, decoupage, collage, manuscript commonplace books, florilegia, notebooks, and friendship albums. <em>Paper Slips</em> uses these manuscript materials to recover an under-recognized tradition of scrap-thinking and, in the process, elaborate a more expansive and democratic account of the populations who participate in the history of literature and art. 
<br><br>
I argue that the often-anonymous individuals who cultivated that scrap-thinking should be recognized as significant theorists of modernity and modern media: Roland Barthes’ and Walter Benjamin’s fascination in their writing with the figure of the female amateur and her domestic handicraft is, in other words, no accident. Pursuing that argument and articulating those connections, this book recovers these amateurs’ papery poetics and the papyromania –the art historian’s term for an over-zealous commitment to the illusionistic representation of paper—of the visual culture they created. It traces in their handicraft, as in published sources from the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the beginnings of ephemerology—the study and the preservation of the bits and pieces of unbound, light-weight, disposable print that increasingly were defined against the bound book. And <em>Paper Slips</em> thinks, as well, about how with its ways of getting lost and then turning up again by chance, flimsy, fugitive paper scraps could in this era model a disconcerting kind of time-travelling—a dynamic of latency and re-animation that positions the scrap at odds with the linearity and chronological normativity so often promoted by the book.

- name: "<em>Believing in Novels</em>"
  description: "This is a project on novels’ depiction of believers and novel-readers’ professions of belief in what they read. It sees me quarreling with the field of novel studies for its tendency to fall back on frameworks of modernization and secularization when it values the fictionalizing that novels do. It has for some time been a commonplace of novel theory that in the eighteenth century the novel, by making fictionality its own, came into its own while it found its aesthetic identity as a work of literature. I have been wondering whether this account exaggerates the aesthetic autonomy, the generic unity, in short, the degree of novelhood that the early novel claimed. And I have been trying out in some recent essays (which I hope will soon gel as a book) a form of novel studies that defers more determinedly to the <em>porosity</em> of eighteenth-century and Romantic-period British fiction—including the porosity that makes it a challenge to conceive of a work like Samuel Richardson’s <em>Clarissa</em> as occupying, either in 1747 or in 2024, a space that is wholly insulated from the domain of religion. I have, for instance, been writing about the hoax’s role, from Horace Walpole’s <em>Castle of Otranto</em> on, in the rise of Gothic fiction and how that role (supplementing its role in eighteenth-century sectarian politics) confronts us with the possibility that a given narrative’s novelhood can be a conditional thing: the possibility that what should be it defining fictiveness might well prove instead to be something that is discoverable only, so to speak, <em>after the fact</em>, at the moment when a properly fictional narrative takes the place of the factual or pseudo-factual narrative that will earlier have come into being because somebody has taken the hoaxer’s bait. As part of this project, I have been writing about David Hume in his double guise as philosopher of belief and a pioneer of the kind of reception aesthetics that I have just sketched. I have been writing, as well, about James Hogg’s <em>Private Memoirs and Confessions of a Justified Sinner</em> and how Hogg’s novel both builds on and overturns an account of the protocols of reading that by 1824 had become standard within the culture of the British novel: an account of how it was incumbent on novel-readers to entertain, precisely as entertainment, the beliefs of others."
